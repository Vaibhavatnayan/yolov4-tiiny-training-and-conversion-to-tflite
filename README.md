# This repository guides you through the training of the yolov4-tiny and conversion to tflite with roboflow
Training via darknet and roboflow is a famous google colab notebook made by ultralytics only. I have use the same notbook but customised it for own usecase.
First step is to prepare your dataset and upload on the roboflow for the anotation. #you can also upload your already anotated dataset to roboflow(roboflow is a great platform for the data operations as well as for the various data sources)
Extract the dataset in the darknet format to match the format of the training architecture
Copy the URL link and paste into the training notbook cells.
The training notebook is well designed and format with every details, So the rest of the procedure can be find in the notebook itself
Thank you
